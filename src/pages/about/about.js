            Hello! Iâ€™m Kristyl Axlee Alegre, a passionate Cybersecurity
            Specialist and Web Developer with a strong foundation in Network
            Technology. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information
            Technology, majoring in Network Technology from Batangas State
            University - The National Engineering University. My academic
            journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of computer
            networks, cybersecurity principles, and web development, which
            fueled my passion for technology and problem-solving. I have always
            been fascinated by how technology shapes the world, and this
            curiosity led me to explore various aspects of IT, from web
            development to cybersecurity.
